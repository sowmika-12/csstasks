    <h1>EXTERNAL STYLE</h1>
    <P> External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always saved with the . css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page. </P>
